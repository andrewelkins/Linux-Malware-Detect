      quarantined data or viewing user reports

[Change] added OSTYPE check on monitor mode to disable on FreeBSD, pending kqueue alternative
         to inotifywait

[Change] added sample ignore values into ignore_inotify along with sane defaults to

[Fix] hexdepth greater than 65Kb caused an 'argument list too long' error with hexstring.pl
      which would fail-clean any malware on hex checks
